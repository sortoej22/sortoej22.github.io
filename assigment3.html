<h1>Dream that happened in 2021</h1>
<p>I saw a young man arrive at the door of my house and I could see that he was waiting to be let in when I passed in front of him and he greeted me with his hand raised and waving it sideways. I was passing by at that moment because I was in a hurry to get ready and fix some things because I was going out. I went into the bathroom a couple of times but then I went into my room and started looking for a pair of black pants since they would match my sweater which I was wearing at the time. <b>I went into the bedroom and looked for a small blue square towel. He told me and put it in my palms together, he reached over and grabbed my hands.</b><u> At that moment I said, oh then you will teach my mom how to dance!</u><I> At that moment I knew what was happening.</I> Then he started moving his body and told me to do it, which I did, but it came out wrong. <b>He started laughing, and so did I 😅.</b> My sister told me it was easy, so I threw him the towel and told him to try it. There it ended. I woke up as my mom got us up to get ready to go to Sandy point(a beach in Maryland). In this dream, I saw a brown guy, Asian, a little taller than me. He had a smile and looked like he could dance very well, he also looks like a warm and funny person. In the dream, I felt that I knew him and I also liked him because when <b>he grabbed my hands I blushed</b> and that's why I felt nervous dancing with him..</p>
<h2>Thoughts after having this dream</h2>
<p><I>When I woke up I quickly wrote down this dream in my notes.</I> <u>Why you may ask?</u> Well, ever <b>since I was a little girl I have had several dreams that have been repeated for several times or that ended up coming true.</b> This has led me to believe that these types of <I>dreams have a meaning.</I> Although time has passed and I have not yet deciphered this meaning, I am in the process of figuring it out. Although I am doing this, it is very difficult for me to know right now, for this reason, I have decided to start writing down what I see as a way to remind myself if I forget them. Besides this reason, I also do it because <I>in those dreams I was happy</I> and I like to remember things that even if they are not reality made me smile..</p>
