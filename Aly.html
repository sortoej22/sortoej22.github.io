 <h2>Some compliments for you:</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>I want your birthday to be celebrated as a national holiday because then I will have a day off.</li>
 <li>They say that with age you lose your memory. I say forget the past and live life to the fullest today. Start with the cake.</li>
 <li>Being young is a privilege. Being attractive is a genetic gift. Being cool? That's all you.</li>
 <li>Life should be lived with a smile on your face and no one does a better job of putting one on my face than you.</li>
<li>Siblings and birthdays are two things you'll never get rid of or change. We both like to remind you at least once a year how old you're getting.
Happy birthday to the one person I would rescue in the event of a zombie apocalypse.
Celebrating your birthday is like celebrating the birthday of a friend I couldn't choose.
Happy birthday to my least annoying sister!</li>
